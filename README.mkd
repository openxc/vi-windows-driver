OpenXC Vehicle Interface Windows Driver
========================================

This is a Windows driver for an [OpenXC vehicle
interface](http://openxcplatform.com/vehicle-interface/hardware.html) attached
via USB. You must install this driver to send and receive data through the VI
from Windows (including Cygwin). The driver is compatible with 32-bit and 64-bit
Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, Vista and XP.

After downloading the driver files, plug the VI into your computer via USB.
Windows will search for a driver but will be unable to find one - you have to
manually browse to the folder where you downloaded this driver.

1. Most likely you will have to following the instructions at
   http://www.howtogeek.com/167723/how-to-disable-driver-signature-verification-on-64-bit-windows-8.1-so-that-you-can-install-unsigned-drivers/
   to disable the Windows 8.1 security setting disallowing unsigned drivers.
   This is the default so you will almost certainly have to perform this step first.
   This procedure requires you to reboot twice to complete so be patient

   from the main Windos 8 screen. To get to this screen hit the Windows button 
   on your keyboard or click the Windows icon in the lower left corner of the screen
3. Type "Device Manager" to search for "Device Manager" and open it
4. Locate a device with a yellow question mark next to its icon. Assuming you

5. Select the bottom option to "Browse my computer for driver software"
6. Click "Let me pick from a list of devices drivers on my computer"
7. Click the "Have Disk..." button, then click "Browse..."

   where you downloaded the repository files and select it.
9. Click "OK" on the Install From Disk dialog box, then click Next on the Update
   Driver Software screen.

    an unsigned driver. Click "Continue Anyway".

## Testing

You can test that the driver is properly installed by using the OpenXC Python
library. Follow the instructions on the python OpenXC site to install the
library, then run the "openxc-version" command. It should report back which car
firmware you have flashed onto the VI (Or report no firmware installed if you
haven't flashed a firmware yet).

Note: This may return a non-fatal error prior to returning the openxc-version
      in which case the driver has still been installed successfully.

If you're still getting errors about USB not being found/installed, restart your
computer, and if the issue persists, come ask for help in the Google Group.
